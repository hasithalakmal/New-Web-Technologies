(Note. Not to be confused with Ray Ennis of Swinging Blue Jeans.) These never reached the same commercial heights.Racing Cars split up for the first time in the late 1970s. In 1980 Morty released a solo album 'Love Blind.' In 1981 Morty joined a band called The Bleeding Hearts with musicians Paul Rosser, Bob Watkins & Dave Iles, it was suggested by Morty that they call themselves Racing Cars, as it was his name. When this band came to an end, lead vocalist Morty has sung backing vocals for artists including The Beach Boys, Tina Turner and Bryan Adams. Morty got together with local musicians and formed the Gareth Thomas Mortimer Band (GTM Band).Morty, Graham Hedley Williams and Paul Rosser reunited as Racing Cars but said "We were a bit reluctant. We're a bit long in the tooth and a bit out of touch but we finally said yes." They continue to play gigs across Europe, after reforming in 2000 with a new album, Bolt From The Blue and a gig at the Cardiff International Aren Racing Cars most recent album Second Wind was released in October 2007.[3] Racing Cars performed their last concert together on 11 April 2009 at the Parc and Dare theatre, Treorchy, though they made an appearance at the tribute concerts for Man guitarist Micky Jones in Pontardawe on 18 September 2010. They also reformed for a one-off concert 'Rock At The Park' at Merthyr Tydfil's Football ground, however these were without Simon Davies (Keyboards).</p></article>
